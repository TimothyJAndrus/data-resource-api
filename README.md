# Data Resource API

An elegant, opinionated framework for deploying BrightHive Data Resources with zero coding.

## What is a Data Resource

[BrightHive](https://brighthive.io) is in the business of building **Data Trusts**, which are *legal, technical, and governance frameworks that enable networks of organizations to securely and responsibly share and collaborate with data, generating new insights and increasing their combined impact.*

**Data Resources** are a core element of Data Trusts and may be loosely defined as *data that is owned by or stewarded over by members of Data Trusts.*

From the technical perspective, a BrightHive Data Resource is an entity comprised of the following elements:

- **Data Model** - The data model consists of one or more database tables and associated Object Relational Mapping (ORM) objects for communicating with these tables.
- **RESTful API** - Data managed by Data Resources are accessed via RESTful API endpoints. These endpoints support standard operations (i.e **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, **DELETE**).
- **Data Resource Schemas** - Data Resource Schemas are JSON documents that define the data model, API endpoints, and security constraints placed on the specific Data Resource. These schemas are what allow for new Data Resources to be created without new code being written.
