### Customize your JSON schema

The Data Resource API auto-magically instantiates data stores and corresponding endpoints without any coding.

Each JSON file in the `schema` directory delineates a resource, namely: its RESTful paths ("api"), and its data model ("datastore"). Create a new resource by adding another JSON file to the `schema` directory. (Visit the `schema` directory for example JSON files.)

### Enable or disable methods

A resource JSON blob defines RESTful methods. These can be enabled or disabled.

```JavaScript
{
  "api": {
    "resource": "name_of_endpoint",
    "methods": [
      {
        "get": {
          // enable the method
          "enabled": true,
          "secured": true,
          "grants": ["get:users"]
        },
        "post": {
          // disable the method
          "enabled": false,
          "secured": true,
          "grants": ["get:users"]
        },
...
```

### Toggle authentication

The Data Resource API makes use of [BrightHive authlib](https://github.com/brighthive/authlib) for adding authentication to endpoints. Authentication can be toggled on or off â€“ on a per method basis.

```JavaScript
{
  "api": {
    "resource": "name_of_endpoint",
    "methods": [
      {
        "get": {
          "enabled": true,
          // do not require authentication
          "secured": false,
          "grants": ["get:users"]
        },
        "post": {
          "enabled": false,
          // require authentication
          "secured": true,
          "grants": ["get:users"]
        },
...
```

### Define the Table Schema

The Data Resource API utilizes [the Table Schema from fictionless data](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/). The Table Schema is represented by a "descriptor", or a JSON object with particular attributes. In a Data Resource schema, the descriptor occupies the value of "datastore" >> "schema". A schema can have up to four properties, among them: `primaryKey`, `foreignKeys`, and `fields`.

The `fields` must be an array of JSON objects, and each object must define a field on the data model. A field definition should include, at minimum, a `name`, `type` (defaults to String), and `required` (defaults to `false`).

Frictionless data and, correspondingly, the Data Resource API can be particular about what goes inside a field descriptor. `TABLESCHEMA_TO_SQLALCHEMY_TYPES` defines the available types in the frictionless schema and the corresponding types in sqlalchemy. Stick to these types, or you can anticipate unexpected behavior in your API! (See `data-resource-api/data_resource_api/factories/table_schema_types.py` for more context.)

```python
TABLESCHEMA_TO_SQLALCHEMY_TYPES = {
    'string': String,
    'number': Float,
    'integer': Integer,
    'boolean': Boolean,
    'object': String,
    'array': String, # Not supported yet
    'date': Date,
    'time': DateTime, # Not supported yet
    'datetime': DateTime,
    'year': Integer,
    'yearmonth': Integer, # Not supported yet
    'duration': Integer,
    'geopoint': String,
    'geojson': String, # Not supported yet
    'any': String
}
```

### Add foreign keys

Creating a foreign key involves making two additions to the JSON.

First, add the foreign key as a field in the `schema`:

```JavaScript
  "datastore": {
    "tablename": "programs",
    "restricted_fields": [],
    "schema": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "location_id",
          "title": "Provider ID",
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "Foreign key for provider",
          "required": false
        },
...
```

Second, define the foreign key in the `foreignKeys` array:

```JavaScript
"datastore": {
  "tablename": "programs",
  "restricted_fields": [],
  "schema": {
    "fields": [
      // Descriptor for location_id field, plus other fields
...

    ],
    "foreignKeys": [
      {
        "fields": ["location_id"],
        "reference": {
          "resource": "locations",
          "fields": ["id"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Hide fields

Sometimes, a data resource has fields that contain important information (e.g., a source URL, a UUID) that should not be visible in the API. Hide these fields by adding the field `name` to the list of `restricted_fields`.

```JavaScript
"datastore": {
  "tablename": "programs",
  "restricted_fields" : ["location_id"],
...
```

### Many to many

To create a many to many resource add the relationship to the API section.

```JavaScript
{
  "api": {
    "resource": "programs",
    "methods": [
      {
        "custom": [
          {
            "resource": "/programs/credentials"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
```

This will generate a many to many relationship.

#### POST
To add a resource you would POST and in the body include the child field as a parameter.
]
#### GET
To query the relationship you have to go to `/programs/1/credentials`. The relationship will not currently show up if you simply query `/programs/1`.
,4

#### PUT
To replace the relationship perform a `PUT` to `/programs/1/credentials` with the full list of primary keys.

```json
{
  "credentials": [2,3]
}
```

#### PATCH
To append a primary key to the relationship list perform a `PATCH`. If you currently have a list of `"credentials": [1]` and you perform `PATCH` with `"credentials": [2,3]` it will return `"credentials":[1,2,3]`

#### DELETE
You can perform a `DELETE` that will remove the given items from the list. If you wish to remove all items perform a `PUT` with an empty list.

Given that you have a list of relationships, `[1,2,3,4,5]`:

Performing a `DELETE` with
```
{
  "credentials": [2]
}
```

Results in `[1,3,4,5]`.

You can also give more than one item. Given that you have a list of relationships, `[1,2,3,4,5]` and we perform the following with `DELETE`
```
{
  "credentials": [1,3,5]
}
```

Results in `[2,4]`.
